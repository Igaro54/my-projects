# my-projects
Every mini-projects I made using Python

I don't usually finish them because I want to work on a serious and useful project
My style of coding can be criticize but as far as I know, I'm alone to code those and I understand myself :)
Thanks for any interesting you put into my projects and don't hesitate to ask me questions or contact me for project you want to make using my help!

(btw, all of these projects were pulled on GitHub in the same time, so there is no point to compare the evolution of my coding skills through the upload date)
