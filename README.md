# my-projects
Every mini-projects I made using Python

I don't usually finish them because I want to work on a serious and useful project
My style of coding can be criticize but as far as I know, I'm alone to code those and I understand myself :)
Thanks for any interesting you put into my projects and don't hesitate to ask me questions or contact me for project you want to make using my help!
